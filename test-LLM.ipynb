      "\u001b[1;33mEssay: \u001b[0m The development of driverless cars will not be easy and it will probably take a long period of time to complete. In the article, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", it is explained to us how the development of driverless cars is going and to point out to us all the pros and cons of these driverless cars. Should these cars be invented? I believe these cars should not be invented due to the fact that there would have to be many upgrades to roads which are expensive, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and new laws that will need to be created to protect either the rights of passengers inside the driverless car or the rights of the manufacturers who built these driverless cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driverless cars are a good idea to a certain point. These cars would not be a good idea because many things would have to be adjusted to existing roads, which would be very costy . In paragraph 3 the author says,\" These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" This proves that cars like this would require many adjustments, that are not cheap, to existing roads and that the cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our country is always looking for whats best for everyone, and having driverless cars may put people in danger. Manufaturers are planning to put some kind of form of entertainment in these driverless cars. Distracted drivers are very dangerous for pedestrians and the passengers in the car. The author states,\" Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and informatin systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over -- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually safety feature, and safety is a big concern.\" This section of paragraph 8 can help prove my point because if manufacturers put entertainment in cars that would be distracting the driver which is not safe for the passengers and the pedestrians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many new laws would have to be created by the government to either protect the passengers in the cars or the manufacturer. Who would be responsible for an accident if the person in the driverless car got in a automobile accident. The author proves my point when he or she says, \" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -- the driver or manufacturer?\"\n",
      "\n",

I find that there are many reasonable pros and things that manufacturers should be proud of, but i also believe there are some things that the manufacturers need to think about. I believe that these cars should not be develop due to the things in explaikn in paragraphs before such as: expensive new upgrades to roads, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and laws that would need to be created. \n",

Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think. But even if you drive a smart car or hybrid, emissions from these cars still affect the world around us.

      "People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be \"Happier without them.\" Lowering the use of cars would also prevent so much smog in the air. In Paris, France, the warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air, on monday drivers with even-numbered liscense plates had to leave their cars at home or face a $31 fine. Then on tuesday, motorists with odd numbered lisence plates had to do the same. This led to decreases in the amount of smog in the air. The warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. Another instance is in Bogota, Comlubia, where there was a car-free day. According to buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaze, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower the air pollution.\" This has led to newer sidewalks being paved, and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts to pop up all over the city.\n",

Every teenager can't wait until their 16th birthday because, for mostly every kid, that means that they go get their drivers liscense and possibly their very own car. Also, adults always look at getting a nice luxurious car and the top make and model of that year. Well, without a shadow of doubt, we should adopt the plan to cut down our usage of cars. It seems very successful considering 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars. It is detramental to our country.\n",

It is depressing seeing all of this smog and polution in the air everyday. Just a little heads up but the polution increases every single day we use cars. It is a shame seeing such an extravogant and extraordinary country go to crap due to polution. If you want to see how every state is going to look if we keep relying on cars then go to California and see how much of an eye sore it is. Cars are one of the major factors responsible for smog and polution. Polution from your car can lead to animals dying and especially humans dying from your automobile.\n",

      "). Everyone wants to be rich and have the most expensive types of stuff, lets face it who doesn't. If you cut back on putting money towards your car then that would save you a ton of money. Just imagine if you didn't own a car, think about all of the things you would't have to buy and pay for. Cars are expensive just to buy in the first place let alone having to pay for gas and maintain it and all of that stuff that needs to be done to it. Also say goodbye to the mechanic visits and having to deal with the stress that comes from them. It would cost less money to not own a car and just take city transportation via bus or taxi or even car pool. You could even go the healthy route and ride your bike or walk to places close by. There are many cheaper ways of getting places besides cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cars can be very dangerous at times and driving can be as well. You are at a greater risk of getting into a car accident than getting into a bicycle accident. Car accidents happen everyday and most of the time they are fatal. Coming from personal experience trust me, being in a car accident is not fun and is really scary and nerveracking. It can also haunt you for the rest of your life. I almost lost my dad a couple years ago due to a terrible car accident that we were involved in that wasn't our fault. He hasn't worked since that day because he hasn't been healthy enough to do what he was doing. We both, still to this day, feel the gruling affects from that accident physically, mentally, and emotionally. It took a toll on us and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder what would of been if we didn't get into that accident. So wouldn't you feel more safe in a bus knowing that your less likely to get hurt than in a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without question it is neccesary to cut back on car usage and start going green and using public transportation instead. Cars are a crucial part of our polution today and that can easily change. All signs point towards the better option being to take a step back from cars for a little bit and see what the result is. Atleast once a week say that you can't use cars as transportation. This idea seems very good and well thought out and it will definetly show improvements that we want to see. So lets do it and see how much it affects our country. I know it will change it and make it better!               \n",
